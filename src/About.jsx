            <h1 className="text-2xl pb-1">About me</h1>
            <p className="text-minor-1 pb-1"> I'm a 27-year-old based in Kraków, looking for job opportunities either locally or remotely. Polish is my native language, and I have a solid command of English, supported by a B2 certification. While my writing and speaking skills are at a B2 level, my comprehension of English is well above that, allowing me to confidently understand and communicate in the language. I also have basic German (A2) and some knowledge of Spanish, and I’m currently working on learning Japanese. My key strengths include being responsible, innovative, well-organized, cooperative, creative, helpful, and flexible.</p>
            <p className="text-minor-1 pb-1"> While I don’t have much experience in frontend development yet, I’m a fast learner and enjoy tackling practical, real-world challenges rather than getting stuck on unnecessary complexities. I have a solid foundation in object-oriented programming, API integration, responsive design (including mobile compatibility), state management, and component-based architecture. I also understand version control, branching workflows, and working with SVG files. Above all, I always strive to write clean, readable code that is easy to maintain and understand. I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and bring fresh ideas to the table.</p>
            <p className="text-minor-1 pb-1"> Cars — especially BMWs — are my biggest passion; I have extensive knowledge about them and love working on repairs. I also enjoy gaming, music, sports, video processing, and cooking — my favorite dish is spaghetti carbonara. Plus, I’m a huge coffee enthusiast. </p>
