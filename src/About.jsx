            <p className="text-minor-1 pb-1"> I'm a 27-year-old based in Kraków, looking for job opportunities either locally or remotely. Polish is my native language, and I have a solid command of English, supported by a B2 certification. While my writing and speaking skills are at a B2 level, my comprehension of English is well above that, allowing me to confidently understand and communicate in the language. I also have basic German (A2) and some knowledge of Spanish, and I’m currently working on learning Japanese. My key strengths include being responsible, innovative, well-organized, cooperative, creative, helpful, and flexible.</p>
            <p className="text-minor-1 pb-1"> While I don’t have much experience in frontend development yet, I’m a fast learner and enjoy tackling practical, real-world challenges rather than getting stuck on unnecessary complexities. I have a solid foundation in object-oriented programming, API integration, responsive design (including mobile compatibility), state management, and component-based architecture. I also understand page accessibility, version control, branching workflows, and working with SVG files. Above all, I always strive to write clean, readable code that is easy to maintain and understand. I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and bring fresh ideas to the table.</p>
            <p className="text-minor-1 pb-1"> My studies taught me to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges, equipping me with expertise in specialized software for land surveying, geodesy, photogrammetry, and image processing.
                Working on numerous group projects honed my ability to collaborate, and both my engineering and master’s theses—large and complex—were completed in collaboration with a friend.</p>
            <p className="text-minor-1 pb-1"> Cars—particularly BMWs—are a major passion of mine, and my extensive knowledge and hands-on experience with them complement my academic background.
                The photogrammetric skills I developed during my studies have been especially useful in various car-related projects, where I combine technical expertise with practical work.
                Outside of my professional and academic interests, I enjoy gaming, music, sports, video processing, and cooking—spaghetti carbonara being my favorite dish.
                I'm also a huge coffee enthusiast.</p>
